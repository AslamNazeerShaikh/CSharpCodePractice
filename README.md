# CSharpCodePractice

- Improve your logic-building skills and gain confidence in solving tricky C# questions, try the following strategies:

## 1. Practice Basics Without Inbuilt Methods 🛠️
Write code for basic operations without using inbuilt methods to understand the underlying logic. Examples:

- Implement methods for common string manipulations like reversing a string, finding substrings, or checking for palindromes.
- Build custom implementations for List operations (e.g., adding, removing, finding elements).

## 2. Nested Loops and Arrays 🔄
Nested for loops are frequently used for multidimensional arrays or matrices. Try problems involving:

- Matrix transposition and rotation.
- Summing diagonals, rows, or columns in a 2D array.
- Implementing your own sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort on arrays without using Array.Sort().

## 3. String and Character Manipulations 🔠
String problems often test logic with character-by-character manipulations. Practice tasks such as:

- Counting specific characters or substrings.
- Removing duplicates or rearranging characters.
- Converting between character cases and implementing your own ToLower() or ToUpper().

## 4. Master Basic Data Structures 📊
Collections like List, Dictionary, and arrays are crucial in problem-solving:

- Write your own versions of Add and Remove for a dynamic array structure.
- Implement a simple key-value store like a Dictionary without using inbuilt dictionary classes.
- Practice data retrieval operations like searching for values or keys in a dictionary.

## 5. Explore Code Challenges 🧩
Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars offer problems categorized by topic (e.g., arrays, strings, data structures). These will help reinforce C# skills while building up speed and logic. Choose problems rated “easy” or “medium” to get comfortable before advancing to harder problems.

## 6. Read and Write Code Regularly 📚✍️
Find and read solutions to common algorithmic problems in C# to see different approaches. Then, try writing your own code based on what you learned without copying directly.
